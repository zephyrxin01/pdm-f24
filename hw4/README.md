# pdm-f24-hw4
NYCU Perception and Decision Making 2024 Fall

In your original pdm-f24 directory, `git pull` to get new `hw4` directory.

## End-to-end Autonomous Driving Framework
For this homework, you will need to run the CARLA Simulator. Please ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **System Requirements**: We recommend using Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 20.04.
- **An adequate GPU**: CARLA aims for realistic simulations, so the server needs at least a 6 GB GPU although we would recommend 8 GB.
- **Disk space**: CARLA will use about 20 GB of space.
## Environment Setup
1. **Download the CARLA Package:**
    
    Download the **[Ubuntu] CARLA_0.9.15.tar.gz** Package   from the [CARLA GitHub releases page](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases), and extract it to the `pdm-f24/hw4/CARLA_0.9.15` directory.
2. **Download the Model Checkpoint:** 
    
    Obtain the model’s checkpoint from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1EH0KRhf8-4f0X1h3rsOAB8FQmzI85ULn) and place it in `pdm-f24/team_code/checkpoint`.
3. **Set Up and Activate the Conda Environment:**

    ```shell
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate pdm-hw4
    ```

## Inference
1. **Run the inference script:**
    ```shell
    bash inference_stp3_by_autopilot.sh
    ```
2. **CARLA Server:**

    The CARLA server will launch, and after a default delay of 10 seconds, the test will automatically begin.
3.	**Results and Metrics:**

	•	The predicted future segmentation outputs will be stored in `logs/[Scenario Name]/debug_stp3`.

	•	Leaderboard metrics will be recorded in `/leaderboard/data/pdm_hw4.json`.

## Notes

1.	**Locate TODOs:**

    Search for `# TODO_` in the code. There are five places where you need to implement. Ensure all are completed; otherwise, the inference script will not work.

2.	**Rerun Inference:**

    If you need to rerun the inference script, you need to delete the result file at `leaderboard/data/pdm_hw4.json`.
3.	**Handle Abnormal Exits:**

    If CARLA exits unexpectedly, you can clean the existing CARLA process by running: `bash clean_carla.sh`
2.	**QA page:**

    If you have any questions or issues, please post them on the [Notion page](https://lopsided-soursop-bec.notion.site/HW4-QA-sheet-0fe0e1834dbb4437b326b1a999cd10be?pvs=4).
